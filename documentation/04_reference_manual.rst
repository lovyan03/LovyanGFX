Doxygen
=======

Here's a cool `class dependency graph <_static/doxygen_html/inherits.html>`_, but Doxygen offers many different views that are all available. 


Sphinx
======

This can be a sort of reference manual. It can links to the doxygen rendering of the code, like above, or it can show whole classes or just parts of classes more textually. (This can be enhanced with documentation lifted from the code, see for documented-from-code example `here <https://docs.core2ez.m5ez.com/en/latest/04_reference_manual.html>`_).
